The seamless installation of undermount sinks also contributes to a more streamlined workflow in busy commercial environments, making them an ideal choice for professional kitchens that require efficient and hygienic workspaces. The commercial demand for stainless steel undermount kitchen sinks is also supported by the growing trend toward open kitchen designs in restaurants and hospitality businesses.
